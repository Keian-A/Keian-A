### Hello there!

My name is Keian. I love coding.

Over the last year I have been heavily involved in studying JavaScript and React, and related frameworks / libraries. I have created API Libraries to validate and authenticate a user, as well as instantaneous messaging apps using the powers of Socket.io.

Feel free to give me a follow, or shoot me a message if you are interested in learning more!
